# New Horizons for Robot Learning: Closing the Innovation Loop

Robots act in the real world. When deploying machine learning on robots,
the continuous and dynamic nature of the physical world raises many
challenges which are not encountered in purely digital domains such as
Internet search and social networks. As an example, many learning
algorithms rely on exploration, which, when deployed on real robots, may
potentially result in physically dangerous behaviors and costly
wear-and-tear.

The main objective of this workshop is to provide a forum for
identifying such challenges, to present state-of-the-art research
methods for addressing them, and to highlight best practices for
transferring such methods from research to industry. An important
question is to identify *when* learning algorithms could and should be
used during a robot lifecycle, *how* they should be used, and *what
for*.

These objectives and questions have been central to selecting and
inviting the speakers. They aim at real-world robotic applications of
machine learning methods. Furthermore, many speakers are active both in
academia and industry, and several whose scientific breakthroughs in
machine learning have led to successful start-ups. All speakers will be
asked to highlight the role of open-source software in turning their
successful science into successful businesses. Finally, one presentation
will specifically address how the choice of software license affects
transfer of open-source machine learning software from academia to
industry, and propose models for the management of intellectual property
in cooperations between universities and companies in the field of
machine learning.

This workshop thus brings together roboticists from academia and
industry, to enable an interactive exchange on the future of robot
learning, and best practices on transferring ideas to the real world of
industrial competition.

This workshop is the second edition of "New Horizons for Robot
Learning", the first which was held at IROS 2020
(<https://iros.ai-lab.science/>).
